          In Western Australia there is currently a lack of funding available to
          sporting individuals, teams and organisations. There are many athletes
          within WA who are high achievers and champions in their fields of
          sport, however there is a lack of funding opportunities available as
          sports is a very niche area and there is only a certain amount of
          places up for selection for elite athletes to represent their state,
          country or on an international platform. Many elite athletes train
          over 20-35 hours per week to be the champion’s in their fields and
          ambassadors for WA/Australia, so trying to obtain and retain
          employment to financially aid the number of state, national and
          international events and competitions required to meet minimum
          requirements for sate, national and international selection is
          extremely difficult as they have to work around their sport training
          and competition commitments. Every year more and more pressure is put
          on organisations to provide sponsorship or financial aid to elite
          athletes to assist them in being able to represent WA and/or
          Australia. My CrowdFunding site will help to alleviate the pressure of
          individual requests to organisations each year, and will allow the
          community, individuals and organisations to fund the individual
          athlete or team that best suits and aligns to their KPIs and values.
          My CrowdFunding website will also allow WA elite athletes the
          opportunity to showcase their talents and selections for financial aid
          to assist them in representing WA or Australia on state, national or
          international platforms. The funds pledged to each project will have
          strict requirements on where the individual athlete or team can spend
          the funds to ensure they do not miss out on these ‘once in a lifetime’
          opportunities. For example travel, accommodation, competition/entry
          fees and uniforms.{" "}
