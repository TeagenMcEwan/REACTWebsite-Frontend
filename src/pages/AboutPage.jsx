          In Western Australia there is currently a lack of funding available to
          sporting individuals, teams and organisations. There are many athletes
          within WA who are high achievers and champions in their fields of
          sport, however there is a lack of funding opportunities available as
          sports is a very niche area and there is only a certain amount of
          places up for selection for elite athletes to represent their state,
          country or on an international platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many elite athletes train over 20-35 hours per week to be the
            champion’s in their fields and ambassadors for WA/Australia, so
            trying to obtain and retain employment to financially aid the number
            of state, national and international events and competitions
            required to meet minimum requirements for sate, national and
            international selection is extremely difficult as they have to work
            around their sport training and competition commitments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every year more and more pressure is put on organisations to provide
            sponsorship or financial aid to elite athletes to assist them in
            being able to represent WA and/or Australia. waSportsStars will help
            to alleviate the pressure of individual requests to organisations
            each year, and will allow the community, individuals and
            organisations to fund the individual athlete or team that best suits
            and aligns to their KPIs and values.
          </p>
          <p>
            waSportsStars will also allow WA elite athletes the opportunity to
            showcase their talents and selections for financial aid to assist
            them in representing WA or Australia on state, national or
            international platforms. The funds pledged to each project will have
            strict requirements on where the individual athlete or team can
            spend the funds to ensure they do not miss out on these ‘once in a
            lifetime’ opportunities. For example travel, accommodation,
            competition/entry fees and uniforms.
